I was a named driver on a car i got through my work for my mum. I had a seriously bad accident in the vehicle and it got written off. I made a claim and the company took 3 weeks to make a decision to void the insurance due to the V5 being in my name (the named driver) instead of my mums name (the main driver). This was an unintentional accident made when setting up the insurance and the company were not interest in the trouble this had caused us at all. Rude staff and no understanding for their customers. The company then changed us £300 to cancel the account as they voided the insurance, £1500 for storage of the vehicle when they had taken 3 weeks to make the decision to void and £1200 for the inspector who came to my house to interview myself and mum after the incident. The company refused to give us back our £3800 premium and yet still charged us £3000 charges. This has left us in £24,000 debt and a void on our insurance policy. This company will do everything in its power to not support their customers and get out of paying any claim.

Brightside is one of this. If you used the monthly payments and you want leave them before the expire date (for example if you sold the car) they will be apply full amount of fees plus another £60 and they deducted the last amount (£60) from the full amount. In few words a FRAUD. That is a example that you found in the contract:  “If you decide to cancel your insurance policy outside of the cooling off period, the insurer will reclaim a proportion of commission back from us. We will apply a fee equivalent to that amount and deduct it from any returned premium from the insurer, or add it to any outstanding balance due on your premium finance.”  This is what I signed and unfortunately I will be pay.

Then, a few hours later, the plumber arrived when the tenants had left!  Today, they phoned to say the services would take place in the morning. Then, at 11.30, they were cancelled again.

As a faithful existing customer, you will not get these nice prices though. We were a customer with ORG193. When we sold our car and bought a new one we asked ORG193 first for a quote. The quote we received stated that we would need to pay a supplement of ¬£534 on top of our existing insurance price for the car we just sold (we would end up paying over ¬£1000).  When asking a quote through ORG53 for the new car, we received a quote that was ¬£505 with ORG192 and ¬£509 with ORG193 for the new car. Half of what we would need to pay as a faithful existing customer! So we asked to stop the contract with ORG193 and asked to get the new contract with ORG192. When giving the same details as for the Confused quote over the phone to ORG192 their quote suddenly became ¬£850! Wondering why, if it is because they know us as a customer I would expect our insurance quote to be lower as we have a 30 year no accident/ no claim record. We decided to leave the ORG192 Group completely and go for a quote we received through ORG5.com.","['company-brand.competitor.-1', 'staff-support.phone.-1', 'purchase-booking-experience.ease-of-use.-1', 'value.price-value-for-money.-1']",53,Price Comparison,Trustpilot

I recently chose a broadband company based on their recommendation. The promised cashback never arrived. I have emailed ORG89 and have had no response. All I need is a copy of the recommendation article so I can prove that the cashback is due.   I don't trust them anymore. And since trust is what their business model is based on I can't see how this company can remain as lucrative a money earner in the long term.  A reputation takes years to build and a day to lose. They should be taking this seriously.  UPDATE: I SENT TWO EMAILS TO ORG89 6 AND 8 DAYS AGO RESPECTIVELY (INCLUDING TO THE EMAIL YOU PROVIDED IN YOUR RESPONSE) AND HAVE HAD NO MORE THAN AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE. DO YOU REALLY CONSIDER THIS GOOD ENOUGH?  DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA WITH REGARDS THE NUMBER OF EMAILS YOU RECEIVE MONTHLY FROM DISGRUNTLED CUSTOMERS ABOUT CASH BACKS AND VOUCHERS THAT NEVER MATERIALISE. AND TO THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLAINT EMAILS YOU EVEN RESPOND TO. AND THE PERCENTAGE OF SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES TO CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING COMPLAINT.

Edit on 20 March 2019  This exchange with ORG89 is ludicrous. I am apparently always just one step away from a response, just send your email to this email instead they say. Then when there is no response it's because some very particular wording was not stated in the subject line.  Let's be clear here about the issue. This company promotes other company's services and expects us to trust them enough to spend our hard-earned cash at their recommendation. Yet, when it is provided with information that clearly points to customers being scammed or misked it does not even care to respond. We are talking here about a company that has revenues in the hundreds of millions of pounds (which they have profited from our trust) and they apparently won't even pay someone to read the emails that concerned customers are sending them.   It would be interesting to know if the company is going to rot since Martin Lewis sold ORG89 to ORG102. I also think there should be an independent investigation into ORG89 relationships with the companies it promotes. (if it is too cozy then the public needs to be warned). I do hope that this final review does not get a response from ORG89 as I'm done with this and won't be checking back in to see what further false assurances they make with regards to a response.

The order is not completely processed and one is asked to call ORG128.  We have today with our colleagues at work made online applications for the deal above through the ORG128 website. Unfortunately, on every occasion the order is not completely processed by ORG128 and instead they are sending a message asking the proposed NEW customer to call a number.  when the customer calls the number the agent informs the customer  that as you have not completed online the offer is not valid to you as you have called us and you will have to pay an extra amount plus you will not get the ¬£75 cashback also.  This is quite outrageous as the ORG128 website is blocking customers from ordering the offer deal and the ORG128 is not processing the order through to completion.  This is very bad PR and mis-marketing to state the least. they will try and blame ORG137 expert and blame the website but ultimately they have marketed a product at a price and now it seems that ORG17 are not processing the orders from customers who order the deal.  have contacted ORG17 many times who state that its ORG89 that is offering the deal and they cant proceed...!  ORG17 have stated to contact ORG89 but to no avail. we have contacted  ORG89 but to no avail.  and ORG17 have stated via facebook that.... As this promotion is available through a third party Amir this isn't being ran through ourselves. The monthly cost of ¬£21 is available for existing customers only, however, the promotion states new customers only. This may be the reason why the orders are unable to be processed by ourselves. We recommend speaking with the promoter to discuss this further.

301972139,Having contacted my current energy provider (Scottish Power) to look at cheaper tariffs as my monthly direct debit was likely to increase ¬£100 they could only suggest minimal saving. I had already looked on ORG44 and could see a ORG55 tariff reducing my bill back close to the original direct debit. I was told is is exclusive to ORG44 and to to use it I would have to use it from the ORG44 website. (crazy they can't offer existing customers the same deal on their manage account online) Anyway discovered this tariff required a smart meter and I have been advised before I can't have one ORG55 said after 3 months I would be reverted back to the standard tariff if I didn't have a smart meter installed.(This does not show on the ORG44 website) I decided to speak to an advisor and spoke to Alex he was friendly and knowledgeable and said if the smart meter is not refused but can't be fitted due to a technical reason (which is my problem) then you can stay on this tariff. Not wanting the hassle of this I decided to switch to ORG195 with a very similar cost to the ORG55 offer. Alex took me through all the information and confirmed I did not need a smart meter for this tariff.  So my first dealings with ORG44 have been very good I have while writing this got an email confirming all the details of my supplier switch.

I was most reluctant to change to DD, after years of making quarterly cash payments with ORG55 without incidence or any late payments. However, the only saving tariffs SP offers are to customers on DD. This means that SP is effectively excluding many people from accessing cheaper tariff rates. Amongst these are elderly, disabled, people as well as younger people or families on low incomes, or even those who simply do not wish to use this online service. Furthermore, within the documents explaining the new tariffs there is no mention of this DD exclusivity. Shame on them! They claim that this is not discrimination, but is very helpful to customers. Their reasoning does not make up for freedom of choice.  The ORG44 agent who helped me patiently explore the possibilities also emcouraged me to eventually consider trying DD, which I have done.

I switched to Energy Plus Protection Feb 2021v3 which included Home Care heating and boiler cover. I had  direct dealings with ORG197 regarding a complaint I raised. It came to light that our Smart Meter had stopped working several months ago, so our billing was wildly incorrect. Not U Switch‚Äôs fault but the alleged new cost was therefore inaccurate as it was based on incorrect usage figures. Anyway ... I cancelled my existing Home Care Cover direct debit. At no time did anyone from ORG44 tell me that I was not eligible for the included Home Care Package.  I received conflicting letters from ORG197; one on 29th January advising that they have cancelled my allegedly inclusive cover and one on 4th February welcoming me to the included Home Care package. I phoned ORG44 to check  and it was confirmed that I am NOT eligible. The proposed saving of the cost of the Hone Care element was the greater incentive to switch, so all in all very disappointing.

So called the insurance company to amend my data before the policy started and was given a new quote more than £150 more. so I cancelled and was slapped with a £49.ORG176 administrative fee which according to the 14 day cooling off rules is permissible.

301972663,A great deal on Car insurance through ORG41 but a month later I was contacted as the purchase date I had stated was wrong by over 13 months. I am sure I wouldn't get it wrong by 13 months but Ageas explain it could be an issue with the ORG41 site.   Apparently this increases the risk due to an error with the purchase date and therefore increases the price.  Now they want to charge £38 or offer that I can cancel but only for a fee of £50 to cancel. Eventually agreed to pay £25 as I was held at Ransom.  Because its after the 14 days cool off period I have had my consumer rights removed and have been held to RANSOM to pay more or cancel and pay EVEN MORE!   How many more insurers are scammed this way.  Is this a SCAM between Ageas and ORG41?

You then have to wait for up to 3 days (the time in which they will say respond) for a reply which for some people may be too late.

301973100,"I recently contacted ORG102 regarding gas and electric options.  I was advised I could save £159 against my current spend which they stated was £1399.56.  The reduced cost, with an alternative supplier, would therefore be £1240.56.  Sounds good - not really as the annual cost has been grossly inflated.  My annual spend with my current supplier, after 11 months, is actually predicted to be £1137.41 and not, as they say, £1399.56, that is at the best very misleading and at the worst quite deceitful. £1137.41 is considerably less (£262.15) than their figure of £1399.56.  So their quoted savings of £159 is untrue and meaningless.  I have sent 2 e-mails to ORG102 asking for an explanation but have failed to receive any response.  Their so called predictions and savings are just pie in the ORG169.  As far as I am concerned there are only 2 factors that determine the best deal and they are, very simply, the cost per Kwh and the daily charge.

After I bought Car insurance 18 Dec 2018 via ORG41 I got hit with a form asking for my National Insurance Number. Never been asked that before and does seem Over the Top.  Now on High Alert who would want to give away your National Insurance Number to strangers (thought that was for Government Agencies) had me concerned and did some homework. Seems this question has been asked before maybe since 2014 from what I have read via the internet. Must be behind the times never heard of this myself. Okay still concerned do not want to give away my NI Number to anyone it ties in to my Finance and pension and identity. And what with all the things that i try to protect myself from like dodgy phone calls from persons trying to rip you off by you by saying they are BT and ORG50 the list goes on. So Yes i am concerned about giving away MY NI number. Tried to get some information out of ORG41 and that was a disaster they had not heard of the NI number form for Car insurance.  Went to Car Insurance company and asked them about the NI number.

You will even get a bonus for using one of their insurers (up to ¬£20 in vouchers).  But BEWARE, most insurance companies are shown with a five star ORG207 rating so it gives you a false sense of security.    However if you visit the ORG207 website, you will see ALL the insurance companies on it have a 5 star rating and you can't even read them to determine if they are genuine. What a crooked joke and its on YOU.   If you research the individual company you finally choose on this website, you will find that it usually has very poor reviews on trusted websites like ORG206 and others.   Don't get fooled, go elsewhere because if you ever need to claim, you won't get a penny after you have signed up. This is not a price comparison website, it is a sophisticated system designed to rid you off your money on an extremely unreliable company that will never pay up in any claim.

They say that they did all the checks and thats why they use them my aument is 1 / they have a vested interest via the referal fees ,2/i checked on the web /social networks and there a re a lot of very unhappy people so do these companies just check else where after all they are dealing with the public, point is they can the company is financially viable and or has the right insurance and papers to trade   but if your recomending comanies to the public you must have a duty to see that the company does not do sharp practice on the public its just a personal view .  My view now of comare the market is different from when i started when they surgest a company i will check the company out for my self first befor doing buiness with them i wont be taking it on trust  infact i will go back to the hard way and phone the companies for a quote after i checked them out my self .

However, a few days later I was refunded for these two dresses and told me that reason was because they were both out of stock. I got into the site and found one of them which was ten times the price I bought it (from 15 sterling to 150). That’s why they didn’t send it as they made a huge mistake in pricing.

301973434,"I ordered 3 rubber hot water bottles from a seller on ORG92 Marketplace, an order that was fulfilled by ORG92 ('fulfilled by ORG92' just means that the seller stores their goods in one of ORG92's warehouses, and ORG92 is responsible for sending out the order and arranging any returns). Instead of rubber, I was sent 3 thermoplastic hot water bottles instead, which I am not happy about - I don't buy plastic bottles. I tried to initiate a returns process on the same day the bottles were delivered, only for the website to tell me that this order is not eligible for a return (no reason given). I tried contacting ORG92, but they are routing all contacts through their chatbot at the moment, and the only reply that keeps giving is that this order is no longer eligible for a return - as if I was tardy in applying for one - even though it was the same day the order was delivered. I have tried to contact ORG92 about 6 or 7 times, with no success. I know because of being a law graduate that ORG92 is breaking consumer protection legislation in this country by refusing to provide me with a remedy - they have sent me the wrong goods, goods that are other than described - and now they are refusing to allow me to return the incorrect items: no return, no refund - no refund, no remedy - this is illegal - and at the moment, it seems I have no way of getting through to them to let them know. My health is disabled with several chronic illnesses that leave me unable to work, and although this order wasn't costly I can't afford to waste money on incorrect items that ORG92 is refusing to allow me to return. Also, the hot water bottles were purchased to help me with my health (one of the chronic illnesses is extremely painful, and the warmth from the bottles helps with the pain). Unfortunately, I am on my last rubber bottle at the moment and it looks like I am going to have to go elsewhere to purchase a spare bottle to use when this one gives out (I use them 24 hours a day, every day of the year, so they don't always last long). I would caution anyone against ordering from ORG92 at the moment - unless it is from a seller on ORG92 Marketplace that fulfils their own orders - as they don't seem in the slightest bit interested in providing any customer service whatsoever - so if you have any problem with your order, you may not receive a remedy - and I have found it impossible to get through to their customer service department (it's usually not easy, but doesn't seem in any way feasible at the moment).

301973435,"ORG92 customer service has gotten worse. Their drivers have, on several occasions, indicated that a package was delivered, even going so far as to take a picture, only to discover they lied about having made the delivery. I have gone through the very painful process of contacting them, only to get no resolution.   The most recent incident began April 14, 2020. I ordered birthday gifts for my great grandson in Houston area, whose birthday was May 6, 2020. ORG92 indicated the package (with picture) was delivered on April 17, 2020. I ordered birthday gifts early because I was unsure how fast deliveries could be made during Covid-19. Some items were delivered on 4/17/20, but my granddaughter just told me today that one large package didn't arrive until YESTERDAY, May 6th, on his actual birthday. I discovered this today when I called my granddaughter to ask how Jasai's 2nd birthday went and if he liked his gifts. That's when I was told the driver knocked on her door to give her the package.  You might say, ""Well done! It arrived ON his birthday!"" However, as I have said to ORG92 customer service, when the drivers lie about when packages are delivered, it could create a problem if the item was NEVER delivered. It has happened to me recently, with the USPS. ORG92 indicated that the item was delivered and yet my friend in Chicago has yet to receive the item. Dealing with the postal service is just as infuriating as dealing with ORG92's customer service. Your package never arrives and your are out of the price of your purchases.   ORG92 seems to go out of their way to make it near impossible to get customer service. I'm writing here because when I attempted to chat with ORG92's customer service, I was switched to something called Just Answer. For the price of a dollar (which they claim is refunded) you then wait for the system to match you with a lawyer (yes, that's right, a lawyer!) who will then call you or email you the answer to your question.  Has anyone any advice on how I can do an end run around the ORG92 obstacle course. I've tried their chat, they no longer answer their phones, I'm at a loss.","['company-brand.general-satisfaction.-1', 'staff-support.attitude-of-staff.-1', 'logistics-rides.speed.-1']",52,Fashion,Trustpilot

301972810,"ORG102 don‚Äôt check the quality of the insurance policies they recommend.  After an internet search in Aug 2019 on ORG45, we took out a single event travel insurance policy with ORG185.  A week later in September 2019, we travelled to the Airport and was in the departure lounge before hearing ORG106 had cancelled our flight. Thinking we‚Äôd be covered by our insurance, we made alternate arrangements with the airline (alt airport, alt date), this arrangement did however occur some minor costs.  On our return we contacted ORG102 recommended ORG185 with a claim for our occurred costs i.e. extra taxi‚Äôs, loss of transfers, purchase of new transfers and loss of night accommodation, total ¬£267. Only to get it bounced almost immediately via a email, after complaining they did but our claim up for processing via another company (travel insurance services).  After several unsuccessful attempts for updates from both companies, we got a call from a withheld number asking for confirmation of bank details. The caller refused to offer any other details other than she was from ORG185/travelinsuranceservices (I forget which), I in-turn refused to share my bank details on the grounds we don‚Äôt share such things with unsolicited callers and that even if genuine I didn‚Äôt want an unagreed amount of money dropping into my account and that being the close of the matter. I then got a series of emails asking for the same, which I again resisted for the latter reason. Then they assured me that no money would be paid without consultation, so I shared my details. For the next two weeks I got several requests for my bank details, despite them being previously shared and being part of the now very long email trail.  Two weeks later I again chased progress, only to be informed a Settlement agreement had been paid ten days previously. Exactly what I was worried about and was assured would happen. I then got a email confirming the settlement agreement and methods of appeal. Appeal I did and was rejected, stating the amount paid was correct, to their policy. Which I‚Äôve since read and found to be correct.   WHAT is the point of taking out UPGRADED travel insurance, if it doesn‚Äôt cover a mere ¬£267 of costs occurred when your flight is CANCELLED!!! They paid me 22% of this and made every step difficult, with their unprofessional and aloof behaviour. I hope nobody has a real holiday disaster, after taking a ORG102 recommendation and insuring themselves with ORG185!  BTW, ORG106 claimed the cancellation was due to circumstances out of their control and refused to consider compensation. So I lost a day of my holiday, lost my transfer, plus I was out of pocket and NOBODY put their hands up, said sorry or paid me what we lost!!!","['company-brand.general-satisfaction.-1', 'staff-support.attitude-of-staff.-1', 'purchase-booking-experience.ease-of-use.-1', 'online-experience.app-website.-1']",102,Price Comparison,Trustpilot

Currently I am in country Georgia not in USA and returning the item from here to the ORG52 warehouse in USA is more costly then the item itself. 3. I have to pay the shipping cost which is another additional extra cost for me and wait when the ORG52 will refund the money for shipping (which is higher than the shoes price itself) 4. Wait when the item will be returned in their warehouse which is around a month or 21 working day + Covid 19 situation can make  the wait time longer and after I will receive my money back. 5. All the above mentioned is happening because ORG52 just put totally different size, both pair different sizes and both pair are for the left leg.

You click on trade 10 times nothing happens then you need to go to  a laptop and it says, KIID document missing so this security is not tradable. No error on the app. Their call center said our app is limited we encourage our customers to use Desktop!! Seriously? In this century? All their transfer needs to print manual forms, sign, scan or send to them via post. Just to link accounts you can't do it once you have used your email address. The lady on the phone suggested to open a new email address just for this. LOL Ridiculuos !! Normal ISA can be moved electronically but JISA can't why? Unfortunately that's their process. The form asks for exactly same details. Also Transferring SIPP is a nightmare. ORG211 is expensive but for now I would stick with them, they never hassled me with all this ridiculous processes. All in one I wouldn't even give 1 star to them. Their call center takes a long time to get through and no one has any idea what's going on, the standard answer is unfortunately that's our process we cant do anything about it.

301974059,"Very easy to set up, my LISA transfer from another provider was a bit slow but otherwise painless.  I also opened a S&S ISA with no knowledge of the stock market, very easy and simple and you can select your risk level out of 3 levels (although I can't remember what they were called).  you can see your savings grow and each account has a breakdown.   Only gripe is that you can't wire money to invest/save, you have to manually input how much you want to save in the app (although you can set up auto/monthly payments) and it is taken via direct debit and takes approx 1-2 weeks from the point you add the money on the app before it appears in your balance, only issue with this is that if you do this say 1 week before payday, the amount won't come out until after payday so can mess a bit with finances.    The payday boost is great as you can set a monthly amount to invest/save, only issue with this is that you can only set this up for 1 account therefore I have to manually add money into my other ISA.   Overall a great app but it would be nice if you can wire money so it appears instantly rather than wait 1-2 weeks for it to process.","['online-experience.app-website.1', 'logistics-rides.speed.-1', 'purchase-booking-experience.ease-of-use.1']",96,Trading,Trustpilot

The problems started when I went to make my first trade, but received an error message saying that my residential address was still being verified. Surely, if my account was 'approved', that meant that all checks were complete and my account was ready to use? Apparently not with IB! I would not have funded the account had I not been led to think that everything was good to go.   So, on to the customer support, which is really, really, really, slow and unhelpful. After an hour-long live chat with excruciating waits in between responses, I was told that someone would be contacting me by email soon to help me get it resolved ASAP. I accepted that, but, still annoyed, filed my own complaint ticket as well. 24 hours later, I had received neither an email from an IB representative (aside from another generic one reminding me that my account was now 'approved' and funded!), nor a response to my complaint ticket.   Having lost faith in IB and wanting to take my business elsewhere, I tried to withdraw my funds and close my account, only to be told that I must wait three days before I can do so.

I do a ton of research before I invest, I use ORG212 to look at a stocks growth and performance ratios as well as all relevant financials. I can probably bet that ORG176.9% of dumb money investors using 212 don‚Äôt know what a PEG ratio is or why they should be bothered. And that‚Äôs my point, why allow uneducated people to use CFDs and basic investment if you have no knowledge, it‚Äôs basically gambling. Sure you might get lucky and if you have some decent cash you might make a return IF you‚Äôre doing cost pound  averaging.(if you don‚Äôt know what this is you SHOULDN‚ÄôT be investing by yourself.

I have made recommendations as regards service improvements in past (such as being able to sort by price & shipping combine to stop £0.01 goods with £2.50 shipping; put parcel in 'Special Place behind the rubbish bin') and then noticed them change policy; I'm sure others suggested the same. When things go wrong - and they do over that time period due to sheer volume - they have done what was needed as quick as I expected. A minor point, hence 4 / 5 stars, is that recently they have let some products with misleading descriptions be sold by the 3rd party sellers - and seem to be utterly incapable or unwilling to remove them and keep them removed despite multiple reports.

Another thing, yesterday I order food for click and collect, today I get a notification that my order has been cancelled. Okay.

Lastly, if I choose a delivery between 8 and 9pm or onwards and have an item with a use by date of 2 days, surely that day should not be included as it’s unlikely I am going to use that item on the first day as it arrives so late in the evening then the item has only one day before being past by its sell by date.

301977597,"Well this new nhs repeat prescription service online is a step in the right direction, but with so many flaws!  First, it’s is difficult switching between multiple people (I order for my whole family, 4 people). This is dangerous because items can unintentionally be ordered for the wrong person. I am careful so this is unlikely, but the potential is there. To switch, you have to click ORG64 logo, but this isn’t obvious at all!!  There is no option to change email address, you have to deactivate and start again, losing patient history of ordered meds.  There is no option to add medication on standby in bag to order at a later date. I am just trying to set it up for my family (don’t need ordering now, but later) so now I have to wait to add med details in until it is time to order instead of it being pre-populated.   There is no updates as advertised (request sent to gp, approved by gp, packing meds etc). The only notification I got was order received and order ready to collect. And can’t view this on the service online.  Also when ordering once set up, you have to go through all the details again. Why isn’t there a function to remember basic details like gp practice, chosen pharmacy of collection, exemption status etc. This drags out the process for each person. This is important to add in, there should just be an option to change details if needed.   Otherwise, app looks sleek and again a step in the right direction.

301977632,"I’m Christmas shopping, so I have a lot to buy, but after a half hour of shopping on this app, it automatically empty’s you’re basket so there’s no time to browse and pick up some extras that you wasn’t initially looking for. Unless you order a few items at a time which would mean multiple delivery charges. It’s absolutely infuriating when you spend time adding things to your basket and Broussard’s g for it all to be emptied and you have to start all over again. For this reason, I only shop online with ORG87 if it’s a must. With all other shopping apps, I add things to my basket as I remember about them then checkout when I’ve got everything. With this app I have to jot things down and try and blast through and find everything within the allocated time, it’s like a supermarket sweep. Also during checkout, on the upside I had some vouchers through my credit card, to apply and they went through no problem at all, but then it wouldn’t let me checkout for free delivery despite spending about £500, it would only let me “pay” when I tapped on the £3.ORG176 delivery option. It’s little things like this that make this app so user unfriendly.  I shop online all the time, I don’t go to shops, so as I go about my days, I like to drop things in my basket as I remember about them. I presume that the reason for the basket emptying is to make people checkout fast, but in my case anyway it totally backfired on ORG87 because,  for 1, it makes it a thought to use the app in the first place,  2, I have to paper and pencil a list and type and shop at a million miles an hour to get everything on one order unless I want to do lots of smaller orders and incur lots delivery charges.  I love ORG87 in the actual shops, very good customer service, but this app is just a headache for me. It’s a real shame.
